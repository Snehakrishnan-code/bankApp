Angular was introduced to create Single Page applications. 


=> bootstrap link, fond awesome links are all given in index.html
=> common background given in style.css
=> create a login component and code the login page

Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app. 
An Angular app contains a tree of Angular components. 
Angular components are a subset of directives, always associated with a template. 


call only root component inside the index file
call login component in appcomponent.html page
bootstrap and other links should be pasted inside index.html head section.
give common styles inside style.css
copy-paste pictures/images inside assets file.
unlike javascript, data is not accessed using dom methods... rather data binding techniques are used


data binding techniques in angular
----------------------------------
ts- component
html- view
----------------------
The data transfer would be between html and ts - 

1. One way Binding (data share would be either from component to view or view to component)

    1.1) Component to view 

        1.1.1) string interpolation {{}} - 
        1.1.2) property binding      [property]="value"

    1.2) view to component 

        1.2.1) event binding      (eventname)="method name()"
        1.2.2) event binding using $event     (eventname)="methodname($argurment)"
        1.2.3) event binding using tempelate rendering variable   #variable

2. Two way binding method
    2.1) ngmodel           [(ngmodel)]="value"
                            in-build method in FormsModule package (formsmodule is to be imported in app.module.ts)



to create homepage (redirected from login page) - we will create a new component - dashbord
redirection path is set inside - app.routing.module.ts - inside routes section - set the path as ojects 
note - landing page path should be empty string
also, inside app.component.html (route component) give a common selector - <router-outlet></router-outlet> for routing to happen (otherwise only login will appear on routing)



Redirection in angular (Angular Routing concept)
-----------------------
navigateByUrl - method used to redirection
router - class (inside this class you have navigateByUrl) inside AppRoutingModule (already imported in app.module.ts)

navigateByUrl                  - method used to redirection (for method in one class)
Router                         - class
AppRoutingModule               - module


Dependency Injection 
---------------------
- to use a method of one class in another class
- in constructor
- call class name inside constructor (router) with variable name and also provide access pecifier (public/private)
steps
-----
- access pecifier (normally we specify private -accessible to files and folders within the main forlder)
- variable
- class name
            private variable:Classname



for registration (after login)
-----------------------------
- set path in app.routing.module
- give routerLink method in login.html (instead of href) - to redirect directly to any other component

Note- register() method called in html file of register component, it must be there in the ts file of the same component

to access a data - like database in login() component we need them in register,withdraw, etc - we can use the technology - angular services


Angular Services - 
-----------------
- redundant (to be accessed repetedly)data will be given in angular services
- like database and related data will be given in angular services
- also, many API request need to be send, which we can save in a common location - angular services
- creating a service - no folder will be created..we will have to create one folder.. also only 2 files (ts and spec.ts) will be created
- ng g s data
- the function inside services should be with arguement and return type - must
note: errors -> red undeline - errors , yellow line- warning
- then, the created function in service can be called in any component using dependancy injection


to display user name on dashboard after login success
---------------------------------------------
- save the user details after login - to a string currentuser
- as constructor method works first in every method, we will access the username in constructor to display it first
- access data using dependancy injection in the ts file of dahsboard
- this accessed data is to be taken to dashboard.html   (component to view- string interpolation)

for transaction history section 
-------------------------------
- design a box in dashboard html
- give a <a> tag
- create a new component called 'transaction'
- add a path in app.routing.module
- give the path name in <a> tag - in routerLink 
- path name should be given with forward slash - as the path is directed inside the dashboard, 
it should go back once, from local4200 it will be going to transaction section
- now it will be redirected to transaction
- go to transaction folder and create table in html
- in the database section, give an array called transaction for every user and new registered user also

- transactions in deposite and withdrawal can be saved as object form using push operation
i.e.     userDetails[acno]['transaction'].push({type:'CREDIT',amount:amnt})
        userDetails[acno]['transaction'].push({type:'DEBIT',amount:amnt})

- then create new method in dataservices to return these transactions
- call this function in transaction.ts file in constructor as otherwise there are no buttons or click option to redirect. 
moreover, this content has to appear first
- get login success acno (from login function)and access this acno in transaction.ts
- now get this data in html using angular dierectives

Angular dierectives-
------------------------
we use angular directives to change the structure of DOM and manage DOM

1.) Structural directives - to handle structured data in view of a component   
        - ngFor   - can directly applied in html to access elements from array (this is basically a for loop of these structural data(object or array))
                       <tr *ngFor="let i of transaction">
                            <td class="border border-white">{{i.type}}</td>
                            <td class="border border-white">{{i.amount}}</td>
                        </tr>


        - *ngIf   - used for if (i.e. condition checking)

2.) Component directives

3.) Attribute directives - to make changes to certain part of DOM only on certain conditions

[ngClass]



Form validation in angular 
--------------------------
we create the form in 2 different ways -

1.) Template driven form

2.) Model driven form
    - reactive forms method`
    -------------------------
    - we need ReactiveFormsModule - Module used to create reactive model form
    - FormBuilder - class (to get this class, we are importing ReactiveFormsModule)
             - Group, array, control (three things that will be present on creating a model form)

    Steps - 
    ------
    1.) dependancy injection in ts file and create an object of formbuilder class
    2.) create group, array in ts file
    3.) create control in html page by linking the model created in ts file  using [formGroup]="modelname"


    

    Validate Model Form
   -----------------------

      Validator - a class in angular it includes methods for applying validation 
                - already inbuilt class in angular
                - hence, no module importing and no dependancy injection
    
    try- type validator class in angular - mostly used - required and pattern

    required - it is applying to strictly make a rule that data should be there
    pattern - using regular expression rule

      -access errors in validator rule  (applying in the model created)
      eg. uname:['',Validators.required,Validators.pattern('[a-zA-Z]+')]    
      where, ^a-z means - execpt a-z.... and limit -  '+' is the limit 1 to n.... if '*' - it is the limit from 0 to n....... {5} - exactly 5 alphabets will be accepted....{5,10}


to check if register form is valid - 
if(this.registerForm.valid){
    then the code has to be executed
}


             this.registerForm.get('uname')?.errors       - to access the data that comes in uname (either valid or invalid)

                            - valid   - empty response

                            - invalid - content    (this is checked and displayed in html file)



            we simply have to check if there is a content in the errors o/p  to check if invalid    
            if(this.registerForm.get('uname')?.error){    //*ngIf

            }

local storage in angular
-------------------------
- store       localStorage.setItem()
- access      localStorage.getItem()
- delete      localStorage.removeItem()

to store the data - we have created a method - saveDetails() in dataservices.ts - this method will be called whenever we have to save any item in the localStorage

- once this getdetails and savedetails is done .. you dont need the database definition (userDetails variable)


Parent child component communication in angular
-----------------------------------------------
- create child component
- call the selector of child component in the html of parent component
- create an event (function) in parent html.. which will on clicking open the child box
- define the function in the ts file of parent (access data from localstorage)
- via selector of child (in parent), we can share the data using a property in selector section
- in the ts file of selector , we have to define the property
// data transfer is done
- now, apply ngif (if data is present i.e. item has content) - content has to be displayed

@Input   -  parent to child data sharing

@Output  - child to parent data sharing 

datas only share via selector of component

                            what we did? :
                            dashboard - parent
                            delete - child
                            - NO button
                            ------------ 
                            - click event - cancel method has to work on clicking NO button
                            - cancel method should be defined in ts file of child
                            - create event onCancel using eventemitter class in child ts - this event will be shared from child to parent using output decorator
                            - selectotr of this child is called in parent - go there and use the created event - during this event a method should work - oncancel()
                            - define method in parent ts


date in angular
---------------
Date - class
to access date - just create an object - we will get the present date and time
- formate can be changed using angular pipe


User Defined Event Creation In Angular 
--------------------------------------

 EventEmitter (from angular core)   - class used to create events
 emit()                             - to start the event


angular pipe
--------------
to convert data from one form to another
eg-  date pipe 
https://angular.io/guide/pipes   - search angular pipe


Note - pushing these files to git hub .. when you clone it back, node modules will not be there, as node module is included in git ignore file... as it containes the copy of all the extra added/created third party modules
so you have to instal npm - 
            - open terminal
            - type npm i


SERVER SIDE
-----------
Server created using node - using express framework
        why node technology? - server is asynchronous - can handle number of request at a time .. resolves many at a time
        (php technology is out now - as its server is issue - asynchronous server - one request is resolved at a time - only when one is resolved, it will consider the other request)

- create new folder bankserver outside the project folder 
- open folder and create package.json file (enter npm init)
note - we need package.json file to import extra modules - copy will be there in package.json file.. you can check if the modules are imported or not


----------------------------------------------------------------note continues in the bankserver notes folder---------------------------------


CLIENT SERVER INTEGRATION
-------------------------

http request Creation
--------------------------

HttpClientModule             - module (imported in appmodule.ts)        - module used to create api request in angular
HttpClient                   - class

dependancy injection in dataservices


Asynchronous request in ts
----------------------------------

js                 -     promise                       - resolve   - then()
                                                      -reject     - catch()

ts                  - observable                        -resolve   - subscribe()
                                                        - reject    - catch ()


rxjs             -   library used to solve asynchronous code in ts (no need to install its inbuilt)
(reactive extension for javascript)


Append token in headers of http request
-------------------------------------------
create header 
HttpHeaders                                         - class to create header object

  gettoken(){
   const token= JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('token') ||'')               //token receiven from local storage

   let headers=new HttpHeaders()                                             // header object created to pass token into

   if(token){
    headers.append('access-token',token)
   }
   return headers  

  }

  headers should be global overloaded - i.e. create one more header
